# 🛡️ Open-Source-Cybersecurity-Toolbox 🛡️

This repository contains a collection of open-source cybersecurity tools that can be used for network monitoring, intrusion detection and prevention, vulnerability scanning, and more.

## 🖧 Network Monitoring

🖧 Network Monitoring is crucial for cybersecurity. It helps identify and respond to potential security incidents in a timely manner. Malware infections, DoS attacks, MitM attacks, and insider threats are some of the nefarious threats that network monitoring can detect and prevent.

By proactively monitoring network traffic, organizations can detect anomalies, suspicious behavior, and other potential security incidents. This allows for swift and effective response, minimizing the impact of a security incident and reducing downtime.

🦠 Malware infections: malicious software that can harm systems, steal data, or allow unauthorized access. Learn more at: https://www.cyber.gov.au/acsc/view-all-content/threats/malware-campaigns

🚫 DoS attacks: an attempt to make a website or network unavailable by overwhelming it with traffic. Learn more at: https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/

🔍 MitM attacks: an attacker intercepts communication between two parties to steal data or impersonate one of the parties. Learn more at: https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/man-in-the-middle-attack/

🕵️‍♂️ Insider threats: a threat from an individual who has access to an organization's systems or data. Learn more at: https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-010

## 🔒 Intrusion Detection and Prevention


🔒 Intrusion Detection and Prevention

-Intrusion Detection and Prevention systems are crucial for any organization's cybersecurity. They help to prevent unauthorized access, modification, misuse, or destruction of computer systems, networks, and data.

-By monitoring network traffic in real-time, these systems can quickly detect suspicious activities and prevent potential security incidents. However, regular maintenance and updates are necessary to keep the systems capable of identifying and preventing the latest security threats.

-Intrusion Detection and Prevention systems provide valuable security benefits, even though they require moderate setup and configuration time. These systems are available for Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms, making them an essential tool for network administrators who need to secure their networks against intrusions.
