## 🐉 Wireshark

### Review
Wireshark is an incredibly powerful network protocol analyzer that is widely used in the industry. Its user interface can be overwhelming at first, but with a little practice, you can become proficient in analyzing network traffic. Overall, Wireshark is an excellent tool that should be in every network administrator's toolkit.

## 🐲 tcpdump

### Review
tcpdump is a powerful command-line network protocol analyzer that can be used to capture and analyze network traffic. While it may not have the same user-friendly interface as Wireshark, tcpdump is a valuable tool for network administrators who prefer to work from the command line. However, its output can be difficult to read, especially for less experienced users.

## 🕸️ Npcap

### Review
Npcap is widely regarded as a valuable packet capture library and driver for Windows. It is developed as a successor to WinPcap and offers enhanced features and improved performance.
