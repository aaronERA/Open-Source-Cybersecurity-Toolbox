# 🖧 Network Monitoring 🖧

This section contains open-source tools that can be used for network monitoring.

## 🐉 Wireshark

### Review
Wireshark is an incredibly powerful network protocol analyzer that is widely used in the industry. Its user interface can be overwhelming at first, but with a little practice, you can become proficient in analyzing network traffic. Overall, Wireshark is an excellent tool that should be in every network administrator's toolkit.

## 🐲 tcpdump

### Review
tcpdump is a powerful command-line network protocol analyzer that can be used to capture and analyze network traffic. While it may not have the same user-friendly interface as Wireshark, tcpdump is a valuable tool for network administrators who prefer to work from the command line. However, its output can be difficult to read, especially for less experienced users.

## 🐊 WinDump

### Installation and Configuration
1. Download and install WinDump from the [official website](https://www.winpcap.org/windump/install/).
2. Launch WinDump.
3. Start capturing packets by running the `windump` command with appropriate flags.

### Review
WinDump is a command-line network protocol analyzer for Windows that is similar to tcpdump. While it can be used to capture and analyze network traffic, its command-line interface can be intimidating for less experienced users. Additionally, its Windows-only platform limits its usefulness for network administrators who work across multiple operating systems.
