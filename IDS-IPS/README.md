### Review
Snort is a powerful network intrusion detection and prevention system that can be used to monitor network traffic in real-time and respond to security threats as they occur. However, its rules-based analysis requires ongoing maintenance to ensure that it is detecting and preventing the latest security threats. Additionally, configuring Snort can be moderately difficult, especially for less experienced users. Overall, Snort is a valuable tool for network administrators who need to secure their networks against intrusions.
